# The Project
Now we are starting to make the project our own. What do we want to be? Gin? Wine? Recipies? Something else? 

The front end is the easy bit, maybe if I did a gin one I could use the CGC gins I've recieved?

Needs to contain at least:

- a database,
- have the mysql in classes,
- a filtered list,
- single product pages,
- reviews/checkin on the single pages, with an average,

### Today we did:  *(code files to be provided)*
- Moved setup into src folder
- Swapped product to have private checkins array
- Added utility adder and getter method to product class
- allowed nullable posted item to check in
- created enertiyHydrator to hydrate product and check in as seperate items
- combines to get manually hydrated related items
- updated front end
- removed sql in code to add in db class
