                <h1>Gin 101</h1>
                <p>Most of us love a good Gin & Tonic, gin has become ever more popular recently. But there's so much to learn about this historic spirit. It's traditionally made in Europe, and it's characterized by the use of juniper as a flavoring; also known as a botanical. The word "gin" is the English translation of the Dutch word "jenever" (pronounced yen-e-ver).</p>
                <p>The main criteria for this aromatic, flavorsome spirit is a discernible juniper character, If the distillation doesn’t have juniper, or doesn’t have enough juniper, it is just a weird, flavored vodka.</p>
                <p>Juniper is supported by other botanical characters; traditionally coriander, cassia, licorice, orris and other herbs. Gin is normally bottled at 80 to 90 proof and its flavors range from floral to citrus to fruity.</p>
                <h2>How Gin Is Made</h2>
                <p>Gin comes from the combination of alcohol typically distilled from fermented grain and a specific set of flavorings known as botanicals.</p>
                <p>Essentially, the base spirit is made from grain. Some use a wheat-based spirit and others used barley, grape, sugar and various other bases.</p>
                <h2>What Are the Different Ways to Make Gin?</h2>
                <p>There are actually three ways to make gin. The most common (and oldest) way to make gin is to distill the fermented grain (malt wine), and then redistill it with juniper berries and the other botanicals you choose to flavor your gin with. This will give the gin a bold and distinct flavor.</p>
                <p>Another way of flavoring the gin is to put your botanicals in a basket and hang it inside the alambique you are distilling your grain spirit with; this way the vapors of the alcohol are forced through the botanicals and will retain the flavors once condensed back into liquid, and the gin will acquire a more delicate and subtle flavor.</p>
                <p>Finally, the simplest way is to distill your grain spirit and then infuse it with juniper berries and your other spices.</p>
                <h2>The Different Types of Gin</h2>
                <p>There are four main types of gin: London dry gin, Bathtub gin, Genever and Old Tom.</p>
                <h4>London Dry Gin</h4>
                <p>London Dry Gin has strict regulations about the way it is made. “It has to be made with a good quality alcohol (low on ethanol), no sugar can be added, it has to be flavored prevalently with juniper berries, it has to be at least 140 Proof after distillation, only water can be added to bring down the alcohol content, and unlike the name suggests, it can be made anywhere in the world.</p>
                <h4>Bathtub Gin</h4>
                <p>Popular during prohibition especially in speakeasies, Bathtub Gin is a homemade gin made by simply infusing the grain spirit with spices. Often bathtubs were used for the purpose, hence the name.</p>
                <h4>Genever</h4>
                <p>Genever is the father of gin, a Dutch spirit made by distilling malt wine and then redistilling it with spices and sweetening it, resulting in a sweeter juniper-flavored drink.</p>
                <h4>Old Tom</h4>
                <p>Old Tom gin is the successor of Genever. Born in England, it was made sweeter and spicier to cover the bad taste of the poor-quality alcohol that was used to make it.</p>
                <p>It was popular among the lower class, and was sold through a machine shaped like Old Tom the cat. This machine was built into the wall of the bar, so you wouldn't need to go into the bar to purchase the drink. The point was to avoid annoying drunks getting into the joint.</p>
                <p>All you had to do was put a coin into the machine, pull down the paw and some gin would pour out into your glass.</p>
